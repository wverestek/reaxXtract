# reaxXtract
reaxXtract is a python tool to extract reactions from molecular dynamics
simulations with the reax force field (ReaxFF).

At the moment this is just some rough code I put together and far from being 
finished or fully capable of an automatic analysis, reaction rates etc.

What reaxXtract does:
- extracting reactions from reaxff bond files by identifying changed connectivity
- print reacting atom IDs to the console
- For each reaction found two pictures (before/after) are created in subfolder 'reaxff.bond.file'.dir
  
What reaxXtract does not (yet?):
- take into account positions
- take into account unbonded interactions (catalysts, etc.)
- generate SMILES, SMART etc. output

## Installation

no installation needed

## Prerequisites

Python modules:
- sys, os, random
- networkX

## Usage

```python3 ..\reaxXtract.py -i bonds.reaxff.dump -r 3:10 -a 1:6,2:1,3:1,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8,8:8```

stepwidth for frames can be adjusted at the beginning of the script:
- startstep: index of step to start with
- checkstep: compare to index+checkstep
- framestep: move index framestep every time.
- e.g. startstep 0, checkstep 1, framestep 5: compare frame 0 with 1, 5 with 6, 10 with 11 etc.

colorcoding for the plots can be spcefied for each atom type in the dictionary type2color.
